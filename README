In order to run any solver, an input file instance needs to be fed to the solver.
Copy/Move the desired instance from the "Input Instancs" folder so that is outside of this folder.

If running a C++ program, e.g. cdclSolver on 4queens.txt, enter the following command in the terminal:
	
	./cdclSolver < 4queens.txt

If running one of the python SMT solvers, e.g. slSMT on sl5.txt, enter the following command in the terminal:

	python3 slSMT.py sl5.txt
